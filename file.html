   <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p>I am 22 and completed my graduation in psychology honours with a grade. After it, I planned for studying abroad and opted for international studies. These days I am student with Algonquin College in Canada. Having goals in my head, I aspire to be a successful person, for which I am planning about objectives, working on the outline for implementation, simplifying and differentiating short term and long term goals to reach out the final outcome.</p>
   <p>In my perspective, there are always some elements you need to reach your goals. For me that are: positivity, passion, determination, consistency and spirit to go on. Apart from this, in my ideal time I always prefer painting, listening songs, swaying on beats and most importantly reading articles regarding any topic of psychology.</p>
